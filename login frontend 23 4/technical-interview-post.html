                <p class="lead">Technical interviews are designed to test your problem-solving abilities, not just your knowledge. Success comes from a combination of solid preparation, clear communication, and a strategic approach. Hereâ€™s how to ace your next one.</p>
                <h2>1. Master the Fundamentals of DSA</h2>
                <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are the bedrock of technical interviews. You must be comfortable with common structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Hash Maps. Practice solving problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, focusing on understanding the time and space complexity of your solutions.</p>
                <h2>2. Communicate Your Thought Process</h2>
                <p>Never code in silence. As you work through a problem, explain what you are thinking. Start by clarifying the problem and its constraints. Discuss potential approaches and their trade-offs (e.g., "I could use a hash map for O(1) lookups, or I could sort the array first which would be O(n log n)..."). This shows the interviewer *how* you think, which is more important than just getting the right answer.</p>
                <h2>3. Practice with Mock Interviews</h2>
                <p>Solving problems on your own is different from solving them under pressure with someone watching. Use platforms like Pramp or practice with peers to simulate the real interview environment. This helps you get comfortable with articulating your thoughts while coding and managing your time effectively.</p>
