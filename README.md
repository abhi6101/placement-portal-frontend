This repository contains the backend server for the **Placement Portal**, a full-stack web application built to modernize and simplify the job placement process. The server is built with Spring Boot and exposes a secure RESTful API to be consumed by the frontend client.

**➡️ Frontend Repository: [placement-portal-frontend](https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-frontend)**

## 🚀 Key Features

-   🔐 **Secure JWT Authentication:** Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens ensures secure communication.
-   👤 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A robust system with two distinct user roles (Admin and Student).
-   ⚙️ **RESTful API Architecture:** A well-structured API enables a clean separation of concerns and scalable development.
-   🗄️ **Data Persistence:** Uses PostgreSQL to manage all application data, including users, jobs, and applications.

-   `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate a user and receive a JWT.
-   `GET /api/jobs` - Fetch all job listings.
-   `POST /api/admin/jobs` - (Admin) Create a new job posting.
-   `POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/apply` - (Student) Apply for a job.
...and so on.

## Local Setup

To get the backend server running locally, follow these steps. **Note:** You will also need to set up the [frontend client](https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-frontend) to use the application fully.

### Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or later)
-   Apache Maven 3.x or later
-   PostgreSQL Server

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-backend.git
    cd placement-portal-backend
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**
    -   Start your PostgreSQL server and create a new database.
    -   Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties` and update the datasource properties with your PostgreSQL credentials:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db_name
        spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies and run the server:**
    ```sh
    mvn install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
