## Local Setup

To run the frontend client locally, you must have the [backend server](https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-backend) running first.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox).
-   A local web server to serve the static files (optional, but recommended to avoid CORS issues). The `Live Server` extension for VS Code is a great option.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-frontend.git
    cd placement-portal-frontend
    ```

2.  **Ensure the Backend is Running:**
    Follow the setup instructions in the [backend repository](https://github.com/abhi6101/placement-portal-backend) to start the server on `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Run the Frontend:**
    -   If using the VS Code **Live Server** extension, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
    -   Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

4.  **Configure API endpoint (if necessary):**
    -   In the JavaScript files, ensure that all API requests are pointing to `http://localhost:8080`. If you need to change this, search for the base URL variable in the code.
